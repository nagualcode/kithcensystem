# Kitchen System Microservices Project

This project simulates a kitchen order system using a microservices architecture, allowing users to place orders, manage payments, and track order status. The system is orchestrated using Docker, Docker Compose, and Eureka Server for service discovery. RabbitMQ is used for messaging, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. Each service runs in its own container.

## Architecture

The project is designed using a microservices architecture, where each service handles its own responsibilities. The services interact via Eureka for service discovery and RabbitMQ for communication.

### Architecture Overview:
- **Eureka Server**: For service discovery.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker between services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Common database used by services.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization of all microservices.

### Architecture Diagram

1. Eureka Server (service discovery)
2. User, Payment, Kitchen, Menu, and Order services (interconnected via RabbitMQ and Eureka)
3. PostgreSQL database
4. React interface (to be developed for user interaction)

## Technologies Used

## Testing


### 1. **UserService**
Use the following command to create a new user in the UserService.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}'
```

### 2. **MenuService**
To interact with the `PlateController` using `curl`, you can perform the following HTTP requests based on the available endpoints:

### 1. **GET all plates** (`GET /plates`)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8084/plates
```

### 2. **GET a specific plate by ID** (`GET /plates/{id}`)
Replace `{id}` with the plate ID.
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8084/plates/1
```

### 3. **POST (create) a new plate** (`POST /plates`)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/plates \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "description": "Spaghetti Bolognese",
           "price": 12.99
         }'
```

### 4. **PUT (update) a plate** (`PUT /plates/{id}`)
Replace `{id}` with the plate ID and adjust the payload accordingly.


### 3. **OrderService**


### 1. **GET all orders** (`GET /orders`)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8085/orders
```

### 2. **GET a specific order by ID** (`GET /orders/{id}`)
Replace `{id}` with the order ID.
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8085/orders/1
```

### 3. **POST (create) a new order** (`POST /orders`)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/orders \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "customerName": "Ana Ana",
           "customerEmail": "fred@gmail.com",
           "status": "Pending",
           "orderItems": [
             {

To simulate that the kitchen has completed preparing the order:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/kitchen/orders \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "orderId": 1,
  "status": "completed"
}'
```

### 11. **Check Eureka Service Status**
You can check the registered services on Eureka by visiting the following URL in a browser:
```bash
http://localhost:8761
```
## Database Management with Flyway Docker

In this project, we utilize **Flyway Docker** to handle database migrations. This approach simplifies the migration process by using a dedicated Flyway container that runs the SQL scripts automatically during the startup of the Docker Compose environment.

### Database Structure

We have chosen to use a **single PostgreSQL database** for the entire project to minimize memory footprint, especially during testing and local development. Each microservice (userservice, paymentservice, kitchenservice, menuservice, and orderservice) operates within its own schema inside the same `test_db` PostgreSQL instance. This setup allows each service to maintain a logical separation of its data while sharing the same physical database.

### Running Migrations

The Flyway Docker image takes care of running database migrations. The SQL migration files are located in the project root (e.g., `V1__Create_All_Tables.sql`). Flyway will execute these scripts to create the necessary tables and schemas for each service.

### How to Check the Database

To interact with the PostgreSQL database from the command line and inspect the current state, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and execute the following Docker Compose command to enter the `psql` shell:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d test_db
   ```

2. Once inside the `psql` shell, you can list the available schemas with:
   ```sql
   \dn
   ```

   This will display all schemas used by the microservices, such as `kitchenservice`, `userservice`, `paymentservice`, `orderservice`, and `menuservice`.

3. To list all tables in a specific schema, you can use the following command (replace `<schema_name>` with the actual schema name):
   ```sql
   \dt <schema_name>.*
   ```

For example, to see the tables in the `kitchenservice` schema:
```sql
\dt kitchenservice.*
```
